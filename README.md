# Simple Image Gallery JavaScript app

- use Flickr API to get images from specific Gallery
- create JavaScript object to receive data from API
- add functionality to preview each image in lightbox view
- add functionality to slide to previous / next images preview
- close the modal with click on image

To start the application locally run:
`webpack --watch`

Technologies used:
- JavaScript (ES6)
- HTML
- CSS
- Webpack

Things to improve:
- add no data message in case gallery doesn't return any images
- use thumbnail images for gallery, and load full size image on individual preview
- add testing coverage for all the functionality
- fix arrows jumping on mobile view (for next and previous arrows)
- use svg icons for arrows
- add close modal icon
- use different font
- use prefixes for classNames (for styling and for JavaScript)
